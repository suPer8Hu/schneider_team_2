# Schneider FreightPower Search Engine Project

## Project Overview

Schneider FreightPower is a mobile app developed for small to medium-sized trucking companies that move freight for Schneider’s brokerage division. The app allows users to search for and book available freight, as well as assign it to drivers and provide updates as the freight moves. Over 17,000 unique users log in and perform these actions each month. 

A key functionality for these users is our search engine for available freight. Users can search by the following criteria:
- **Origin/Destination Location**
- **Date Ranges**
- **Freight Types**
- **Mileage Radius**

Many of these search criteria must also adhere to business rules and logic (e.g., you can’t deliver a load before you pick it up). We would like you to design a new search engine for our available freight listed on the Schneider FreightPower app. This solution must meet certain business requirements, but otherwise, the sky is the limit for what you can build. The end result does not need to be a fully polished UI, but should focus on the experience and functionality, with careful thought given to improving the user experience.
